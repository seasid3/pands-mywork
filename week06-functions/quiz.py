# function yo takes one parameter

def yo(a) :
    return a * 2

# here we are calling the function yo
# and are passing in an argument, 3

print(yo(3))


# 1. Nothing will printed out/an error will occur as you havent asked the program to print anything
# 2. you would need to change it to print(yo(3)) to get 6 to print out
